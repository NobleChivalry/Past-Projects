# Past Projects
This is a compilation of some of the past projects and notes I have taken for programming in various languages. My most recent works are on the bottom of the list, while my oldest works are on the top.

1) Notes in Python: Old Python.py is the first set of notes that I took for Python during my sophomore year in high school, which was the time I first started getting into programming. Python.py is the second set of notes that I later took during a college course to refresh my skills in Python. The funny part of these notes is that I learned Python while coding in Python.

2) Direct Messaging Interface Python: This project is when I started working with network protocols during a college course. When the program is ran, a tkinter interface pops up, allowing for 2 computers to establish a connection in order to send and receive messages between each other.

3) Notes in Java as a Project: This is the set of notes I took when learning to program in Java. This is actually a project that contains many classes that I wrote to learn certain Java concepts. It is possible to open this project inside of an IDE like eclipse to view its contents. Similar to my Python notes, I learned Java while coding in Java.

4) String Class C++: This is my replication of the STL String class that I wrote when I was first introduced to C++.

5) Template Array & Matrix Classes C++: In this project, I created an array class and matrix class, both of them utilizing the template keyword in order to allow for whatever object type to be stored into the containers.

6) Query Generation SQL: This project is when I was assigned a couple of queries to try to replicate in SQL using a provided database, this having been my first experience using MySQL directly.

7) Image Manipulation MIPS Assembly: In this project, I had to do some bit manipulation in order to manipulate the appearance of an image I was provided. My program ended up looking quite complex, utilizing a couple of conditional statements and conditional loops that had to be written in an assembly language, MIPS.

8) Triangle Function Testing Java: After writing a TriangleType class that detected what type of triangle was created using inputted dimensions, I had to conduct some black box/functional testing and white box/structural testing using JUnit. Pictures of the results can be found in zip file as well.

9) Mock Portfolio HTML & CSS: After having learned the basics of HTML (semantics of a page) and CSS (styling of a page), I was assigned to create a mock portfolio for this project. W3C was used in order to validate that my HTML and CSS files were well-formed, while AChecker was used in order to validate that my webpage passed accessibility guidelines.

10) Completing Webpage JS & TS: For this project, I was provided a website written in HTML and CSS. My task was to program in JavaScript and TypeScript in order to do some computations and fill out the missing parts of the website.

11) Computing Matching Tokens Python: For this project, I was assigned to create various programs that ran through command line arguments. PartA.py consists of a function that tokenizes a text file, a function that maps each token to their frequencies in the text file, and a function that prints out the tokens with their corresponding frequencies. PartB.py consists of a function that returns the number of tokens that two files share, utilizing some of the functions from PartA.py.

12) Spotify API TS & Angular (File too Big): In this assignment, I had to gather data from the Spotify API, develop a frontend interface with Angular, and make HTTP requests to a backend server to trigger API calls. The app itself provides a browser for users to browse music on Spotify.

13) Sleep Tracker TS & Ionic (File too Big): This project involved creating a sleep tracker app that tracks the periods of sleep a user had and how they felt during the day. A demo video of how to use the app can be found in the project as well, being named "Demo.mp4". The video can be found in this repository too.

14) Search Engine Python: After learning about concepts in web information retrieval, I was able to create a search engine that involved tokenizing, text processing, stemming, relevance ranking, offloading/dividing data, merging data, extracting important page content, indexing, searching, finding shared documents of query terms, and outputting top 5 search results. To actually operate this search engine, indexer.py has to be ran with a corpus (folder of data) named "developer". After a long time of indexing, search.py can then be used to search for the top 5 results of user-inputted queries.

15) Basic Lisp Functions: Lisp was the first functional programming language that I learned. For this project, I worked with something that is called "Pure Lisp", which is like a subset of Common Lisp that only used low-level built-in functions. I had to implement 15 functions in total, some of them requiring helper functions.

16) Prolog Relations: Prolog was the second functional programming language that I learned. For this project, I had to implement 4 different relations. The first one was eval(), which is meant to evaluate mathematical expressions, only taking in numbers. The second one was simplify(), which utilizes eval() to simplify mathematical expressions with variables. The third one was deriv(), which is meant to utilize simplify() to find the derivative of a mathematical expression. The final one was party_seating(), which takes a list of 10 people, who identify as male or female, and arrange them in a particular way. The rule for party_seating is that people at the party had to sit in a circular table, the people next to them being a different gender from them and sharing at least 1 common language with them.

17) Basic Portfolio React: Wanting to learn about the popular JavaScript library, "React", for myself, I decided to refresh myself on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a basic portfolio website using React this time. Furthermore, having heard of GitHub Pages, a free website hosting service, I decided to learn how to deploy the portfolio online. Unfortunately, the file for the video used on the website was too large for GitHub pages, but you can still view it in this repository under the name "Demo.mp4". Here is the link to the portfolio: https://noblechivalry.github.io/portfolio/
